		<h1>JavaScript Browser Support</h1>
		<p>
			In JavaScript certain syntax features or functionalities are not supported
			by certain browsers. In particular modern features such as syntax features
			and method from ES6 and beyond do not have full browser support in older
			browsers such as IE. In order to combat this and allow users to have the
			same experience or prevent erros on older browsers we have some options
			such as feature detection, polyfills and transpilation.
		</p>
		<h3>Feature Detection</h3>
		<p>
			Feature detection allows us to check if a certain feature is available and
			supported on a browser and provide a fallback if it is not. Typically
			features that arent supported in a browser will return undefined so to
			implement feature detection we can add an if statement to check for the
			feature. If the feature it available then the if condition is met and we
			can run the code we want to do inside however if the feature is not
			supported and therefore returns undefined we can enter an else condition
			where we can provide some fallback code.
